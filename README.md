This repositoy contains the files for our EE 541 Final Project. The files are numbered so as to reflect the stage of model development. In each stage there is: a setup file for reading the data, a hdf5 file which holds the properly structed images, and a training file wherein the actual model training occurs. Specifically, the contents are as follows:

Data:
Standard Training Set (1.1 GB)
Bespoke Test Set (2.7 GB)
Larger Training Set (20.3 GB)

Stage 1:
1_validation_setup.py (1.6 kB)
1_validimg.hdf5 (4.1 GB)
1_validationtrain.ipynb (95.1 kB)

Stage 2:
2_full_setup_std.ipynb (121.2 kB)
2_fullstdimg.hdf5 (4.1 GB)
2_fulltrain_std.ipynb (280.7 kB)

Stage 3:
3_fullsetup.ipynb (7.6 kB)
3_fullimg.hdf5 (10.9 GB)
3_fulltrain.ipynb (366.8 kB)

Stage 4:
4_finalsetup.ipynb (12.7 kB)
4_finalimgf.hdf5 (4.7 GB)
4_finaltrain.ipynb (182.2 kB)

The data and hdf5 files are not uploaded due to their size. If desired, they can be sent directly. Using the setup files on the data will automatically generate the hdf5 files.
